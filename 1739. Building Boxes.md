You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to n units. You are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:

You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
If box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.
Given an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
Example 2:



Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
Example 3:



Input: n = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the back side.
