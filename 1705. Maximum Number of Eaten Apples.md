There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n days. On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.

You decided to eat at most one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first n days.

Given two integer arrays days and apples of length n, return the maximum number of apples you can eat.

 

Example 1:

Input: apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: You can eat 7 apples:
- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
- On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
Example 2:

Input: apples = [3,0,0,0,0,2], days = [3,0,0,0,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can eat 5 apples:
- On the first to the third day you eat apples that grew on the first day.
- Do nothing on the fouth and fifth days.
- On the sixth and seventh days you eat apples that grew on the sixth day.
 

Constraints:

apples.length == n
days.length == n
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= apples[i], days[i] <= 2 * 104
days[i] = 0 if and only if apples[i] = 0.

// 也可以申请一个长数组代替priority queue，用空间换时间

struct compare {
    bool operator()(pair<int, int>& a, pair<int, int>& b) {
        return a.first > b.first;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    int eatenApples(vector<int>& apples, vector<int>& days) {
        // 苹果腐烂得那一天和对应得苹果数目
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, compare> pq;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < days.size() || !pq.empty(); ++i) {
            // 今天成熟了多少苹果，也就是说days[i]天后腐烂
            if (i < days.size())
                pq.push(make_pair(i + days[i], apples[i]));
            // 将腐烂得苹果踢出队列
            while (!pq.empty() && (pq.top().first == i || pq.top().second == 0)) {
                pq.pop();
            }
            // 吃一个苹果
            if (!pq.empty()) {
                auto front = pq.top();
                pq.pop();
                --front.second;
                pq.push(front);
                ++res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
